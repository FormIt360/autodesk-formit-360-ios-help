# Scale a Group

Scale a Group instance while maintaining the relationship to other instances

An instance of a Group can be scaled and still maintain the relationship between the different instances of the group even though they are different sizes.

1. Select a Group instance
2. Tap and hold the Group instance to display the Context Menu and tap the Scale button ![](../.gitbook/assets/guid-aa1edca0-b86d-4c6d-952f-5a702d29e536-low.png)
3. Edit the scaled Group instance by double-tapping it. Note that the other smaller group instances also react to the change.
