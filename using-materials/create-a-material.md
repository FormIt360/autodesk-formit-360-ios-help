# Create a Material

Use the Material Editor to create new materials to use in your scene.

You can create your own materials based on custom bitmap files.

### Create a Material

2. Choose a bitmap to use for the material

Load an image from a file, or even take a photo with a tablet.

1. Choose a color for the material. The color will blend with any bitmap that may have been loaded.

* Textures are imported from your Camera Roll or Photo Library. Once imported, you can edit the texture's mapping using the Material Crop tool. You can crop textures to define the vertical and horizontal tile scale in meters or feet.
