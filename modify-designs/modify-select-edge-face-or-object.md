You can select it from the context menu after tapping over the empty canvas. Then draw a line around your desired selection area. Which types of entities are picked by the lasso tool depends on the items selected in the Selection menu, which you open by tapping the  ![](../.gitbook/assets/selectionicon.png) icon on the left of the bottom tool bar
