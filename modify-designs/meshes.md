# Meshes

Meshes are a special kind of object. They consist of a set of triangles, some times a large number, and are typically imported from other formats. You can convert meshes back into solid objects and vice versa. More details about meshes can be found [**here**](https://windows.help.formit.autodesk.com/tool-library/meshes).
