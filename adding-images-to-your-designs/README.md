# Adding Images to Your Designs

Use ground overlays and other images to add clarity and realism to a design.

You can use image files in multiple ways, such as ground overlays to add additional data to a sketch or to trace over. After an image has been imported as a ground overlay, you can use the palette on the right-side of the screen to modify the image's properties. From the palette, you can edit the image's name and transparency. You can even manage all the ground overlays including any satellite imagery you brought in using the Vertical Order tool.

Vertical Order provides a way to stack overlays according to your needs.
