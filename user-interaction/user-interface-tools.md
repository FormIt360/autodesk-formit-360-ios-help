* With the View Settings menu, you can choose from a selection of preset views. These views will allow you to quickly visualize your model from different perspectives, plan and elevation views and zoom levels. The **Orbit - Swivel** option determines the behavior of the one finger drag action. When **Orbit** is selected, the camera will move around a fixed point in the scene, continuously looking at that point. This works well to navigate around objects from the outside. **Swivel** keeps the camera at a fixed location and rotates the direction at which the camera is pointed. Think of sitting on a rotating office chair and spinning around. This works well when you are located inside a building and want to look around the interior without moving the camera.
