5. Tap the ![](../.gitbook/assets/guid-031d977c-eeaa-44ad-b73d-19fb4a2c0117-low.jpg)symbol to toggle between Month Peak or Year Cumulative.

   Change between Month Peak, which gives the peak solar insolation value in BTU/sq ft \(or Wh/sq m\) for each month, and Year Cumulative, which gives the total insolation in kw/Sq m. Month Peak is useful for developing a shading strategy for the building fa√ßade. Year Cumulative is useful for determining the potential for photovoltaic cells.

6. Move the slider to vary the time of year.
