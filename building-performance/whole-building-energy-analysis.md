The FormIt Pro Energy Analysis feature allows you to better understand how your design will perform based on a number of factors. To get started, you must first set a Location for your project and have at least one solid object with Levels applied. Tap the Energy Analysis button ![](../.gitbook/assets/guid-4b5571df-d3b2-4693-85ff-5bed468431bb-low.png)to open the Energy Analysis Dashboard.
