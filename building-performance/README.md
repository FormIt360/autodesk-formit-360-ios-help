# Building Performance

Start a BIM workflow by evaluating the performance of elements from the beginning of the design process.

## Building Performance

Properties provides information about a chosen object. The values update as you make changes. Use the Solar and Energy Analysis features \(Pro only\) to determine how the building will perform.
